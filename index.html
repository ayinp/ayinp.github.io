            <h2>Artist Statement</h2>
            <div id="artist">
                <p>My name is Ayin Pitman,  and I am an autistic adult. There are a lot of things people overlook when they see another person, and I decided to make a website to help raise awareness for high-masking autism. The game I have programmed distills many of my daily struggles into an easily understandable statistics representation. Social interactions decrease sanity, and spending the time to decompress alone decreases the social stat. The user also has to balance grades and getting enough sleep.</p>
                <p> This project is important because there are thousands of highly masking autistic adults that go overlooked both in the medical field and also in daily life. Their struggles are not talked about enough for neurotypicals to understand or really think about. To the average passer-by I seem relatively normal. But underneath that is a layer of struggle that is difficult to describe. Some days are better than others, but every day is accompanied by sensory struggles to some degree.</p>
                <p>One example I included of this is when the character wakes up to a rainstorm. I think most people don’t prefer the rain. If I wake up on a day feeling overwhelmed and notice it is raining outside, that usually means I am stuck inside a majority of the day. The sensation of rain on my skin and the humidity and wind is very overwhelming, and unfortunately I am not always able to tackle it. On those days I don’t beat myself up, though. I recognise that I need to take care of my mental and physical health above my other obligations. In the game, I programmed that going to class on this day would greatly decrease the sanity while only marginally improving the grade stats. However, not attending class only marginally decreases grades, while greatly improving the other stats, which hopefully would persuade the player to recognise the difficulty that can accompany challenging sensory experiences that they don’t normally think about.</p>
                <p>In the top right corner of the game, I have put small poems for each day of the week. These are meant to form a narrative explaining my mental and emotional state as the week goes on. The poems shorten as the week goes on until Saturday, which I typically use as my reset day. On Saturdays I usually don’t leave my room unless I absolutely need to, because that is what I need to do to prepare for the upcoming week. My hardest point in the week is definitely Thursday, because the end is so close but still not attainable.</p>
                <p>There is a series of black out poems using an Autism Speaks article as the text attached to the website. Autism Speaks is an organization looked down upon by most of the autistic community. I used their article as a base for my poems to make a statement. The first poem I am using their words to exemplify the negative language they use in their article towards autistic people that can be very damaging in association. In the last poem I used their words to create a genuinely positive dialogue, and the sections between fall somewhere in that range.</p>
